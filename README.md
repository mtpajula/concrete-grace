# Concrete Grace

**"An endless isometric world of brutalist concrete stretches to the horizon — a cold, grey maze born from procedural logic. Occasionally, fragile green life pierces through the cracks — you can eat it to survive, but every bite makes the world a little more dead."**

## What is it?

A meditative survival game where you wander an endless concrete labyrinth, consuming rare plants to survive. Each consumption degrades the world further, revealing the hidden truth: **you are the architect of your own destruction**.

Somewhere in this brutalist expanse lies a rare Aalto building — an organic sanctuary in a world of hard edges. Inside waits the Isometric Architect, who reveals the devastating secret: **this concrete prison is your creation, and its destruction your doing**.
